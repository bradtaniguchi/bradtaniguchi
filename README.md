## About Me

Hi, I'm a software engineer currently working with full-stack TypeScrpt web development. I like learning new things of all kinds, from software, to life, to wisdom.

Checkout some of the projects pinned below for some of the "cooler" stuff I've done thats in public repos.

I also have a website/portfolio I'm finally getting around to building. Check that out for more in-depth stuff, but don't mind the dust as its constantly evolving :D

Stay safe, keep learning, keep building üëç
