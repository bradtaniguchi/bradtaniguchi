## About Me

Hi, I love learning new things, challenges, and believe in the value of hard work and doing things right.
I am a software engineer currently doing web development at Intuit!

In my own time I love learning new things about technology, software development, automation. Outside of tech I like reading Sci-Fi, modern-space technologies, and learning new things.

Checkout some of the projects pinned below for some of the "cooler" stuff I've done thats in public repos.

Stay safe, keep learning, keep building üëç
